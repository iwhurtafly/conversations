== Rails Legacy Mapper
This gem provides an extraction of the DeprecatedMapper from Rails 3.0.
If you have a legacy application with an old style routes.rb file this
allows you to get your application running quickly in Rails 3.1.

=== Example
The trigger for using the legacy mapper is the arity (number of args)
of the block passed to draw, e.g:

  LegacyApp::Application.routes.draw do |map|

    map.root :controller => 'pages', :action => 'index'

    map.namespace :admin do |admin|
      admin.resources :pages
    end

    map.page '/pages/:id', :controller => 'pages', :action => 'show'

    map.connect '/:controller/:action/:id/'

  end
